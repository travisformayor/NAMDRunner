# NAMDRunner Documentation

This directory contains the complete NAMDRunner project documentation. Use this guide to find the information you need.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### What is NAMDRunner?
Desktop app for NAMD molecular dynamics on SLURM clusters. Built with Tauri v2 (Rust) + Svelte (TypeScript).

### Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js LTS, Rust toolchain
git clone [repo]
cd namdrunner
npm install

# Launch development app
npm run tauri dev
```
