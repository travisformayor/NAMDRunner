# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Guide for NAMDRunner

## Project Context
NAMDRunner: Desktop app for NAMD molecular dynamics on SLURM clusters built with Tauri v2 (Rust) + Svelte (TypeScript).

## Core Principles
- **Security**: No credential persistence, password-only SSH, minimal attack surface
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript ‚Üî Rust contracts
- **Reliability**: Scientists need stability over features
- **Pattern-Driven**: Use proven architectural patterns and cluster integration approaches

## Essential Documentation (Always Available)

### Start Here
- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) - Documentation index and quick start
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - System design and project overview
- [`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) - Development setup and standards
- [`tasks/roadmap.md`](tasks/roadmap.md) - Current development phase

## Development Workflow

### Before Starting ANY Work
1. **Read the specs** - Use the Context-Specific Reading Guide above for your task type
2. **Check current phase** - `tasks/roadmap.md` shows where we are
3. **Look for active tasks** - `tasks/active/` (should be empty to start new work)

### Task Management (Critical!)
- **One task at a time** in `tasks/active/` - No exceptions
- **Use task template** from `tasks/templates/task.md`
- **Get approval before coding** - Present plan, wait for confirmation
- **Track progress** - Update active task document with implementation steps and progress

#### Task Completion Process
After implementation and testing, before archiving:
1. **Code Review & Refactor** - Use `.claude/agents/review-refactor.md` agent to analyze completed work
2. **Apply Improvements** - Implement recommended refactoring based on what was learned
3. **Update Documentation** - Update `tasks/roadmap.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with final implementation details
4. **Update and Archive Task** - Move to `tasks/completed/`

### When You're Stuck
- **Use the Context-Specific Reading Guide above** - Find docs relevant to your current task
- Review `tasks/roadmap.md` for current development phase
- **Ask specific questions** about the requested feature or cluster integration details

## Quick Commands

See `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` for complete setup and development commands.

## Critical Success Factors

### Cluster Integration Patterns
- **SQLite schema** - Simple and focused schema design (see `docs/DB.md`)
- **JSON metadata format** - Serialized from Rust `JobInfo` struct (see `docs/DB.md`)
- **Directory structure** - `/projects/$USER/namdrunner_jobs/` pattern for persistent storage
- **SLURM commands** - Use proven working patterns (see `docs/reference/slurm-commands-reference.md`)

### Security Requirements (Non-Negotiable)  
- **Never log credentials** - Mask passwords, clear memory on disconnect
- **No credential persistence** - In-memory only, re-auth on session expire
- **Minimal Tauri permissions** - Only enable required commands/APIs
- **Password-only SSH** - No key support (cluster requirement)

### Architecture Constraints
- **Type-safe IPC boundary** - Strict contracts between TS and Rust
- **Offline-first design** - Local SQLite cache, manual sync
- **Single-writer rule** - App writes JSON, jobs write to scratch only
- **Portable Windows exe** - Primary deployment target

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Cluster Integration Pitfalls
- **Don't hardcode module versions** - Make configurable (gcc/14.2.0, etc.)
- **Don't skip error handling** - SSH operations WILL fail
- **Don't block UI thread** - All SSH/SFTP operations must be async
- **Don't ignore working SLURM patterns** - Check reference docs for proven approaches
- **Don't reinvent solved problems** - Review reference docs before implementing from scratch
- **Don't skip reference documentation** - Learn from documented patterns and pitfalls
- **Don't work without task plan** - Complex application needs structured approach

### Code Completeness
- **Don't leave stubs in production** - Replace all setTimeout/mock data with real backend calls before completing tasks
- **Don't implement business logic in frontend** - Validation, calculations, cluster config belong in Rust
- **Don't keep orphaned code** - Delete service layers and utilities that production code never imports
- **Don't treat test usage as real usage** - If only tests use code, delete both the code and tests

## What Success Looks Like
- **Complete functionality** - All planned features working reliably in Tauri
- **Windows deployment** - Working portable exe
- **Maintainability** - New developers can understand and extend
- **Reliability** - Works for months without maintenance

## When to Ask for Help
- **SLURM integration questions** - Reference docs provide proven patterns
- **Data format questions** - Architecture decisions need clarity
- **Architecture decisions** - Get input before big design choices
- **Task planning** - Break down complex work before starting
- **Unclear cluster behavior** - Ask for specific clarification rather than guessing
- **Streamlining opportunities** - When you see ways to improve existing patterns
