# Phase 6.7 Comprehensive Testing Implementation Prompt

## Project Overview
You are implementing **Phase 6.7: Comprehensive Testing** for NAMDRunner, a desktop application for managing NAMD molecular dynamics simulations on SLURM HPC clusters. This is a **testing and validation phase** built with Tauri v2 (Rust backend) + Svelte (TypeScript frontend), focusing on production readiness through comprehensive test coverage and autonomous UI validation.

## Your Mission: Achieve Production-Ready Testing Coverage
Implement **comprehensive testing infrastructure** with core capabilities:
- >80% unit test coverage focused on business logic (not external libraries)
- Autonomous UI testing framework using Playwright for self-validation in demo mode
- Enhanced test infrastructure for continuous integration and reliability
- Performance and security validation testing

### Interactive UI Testing: Autonomous Validation Framework
- [ ] Implement Playwright-based autonomous UI testing for demo mode navigation and workflows
- [ ] Create headless testing framework with automated clicking, form filling, and visual validation
- [ ] Develop complete job lifecycle testing in demo mode (create ‚Üí submit ‚Üí track ‚Üí view results)

- [ ] Create deterministic test fixtures and scenarios with proper data management
- [ ] Implement performance and reliability testing (startup time, memory usage, error recovery)

## üîß Implementation Approach

### 1. Current State Analysis (Critical!)
**What's Already Working (Don't Rebuild)**:
- ‚úÖ Basic test infrastructure with Vitest and Rust testing - Existing foundation in `tests/` directory
- ‚úÖ Mock data and fixtures - Available in `src/lib/test/fixtures/` for UI development
- ‚úÖ Demo mode functionality - Working demo mode toggle for safe testing without server connections
- ‚úÖ Clean, refactored codebase from Phase 6.3 - Security and quality improvements completed

**What's Missing (Implement This)**:
- ‚ùå Comprehensive unit test coverage (currently low coverage across critical modules)
- ‚ùå Autonomous UI testing framework for self-validation
- ‚ùå Performance and security validation testing
- ‚ùå Test coverage reporting and enforcement

### 2. Investigation Commands (Run These First)
```bash
# Check current test coverage
cd /media/share/namdrunner
cargo test --no-run  # Check Rust test compilation
npm run test         # Run existing Vitest tests

# Examine existing test infrastructure
rg "test|spec" tests/ src/ -A 5 -B 5
rg "#\[cfg\(test\)\]|#\[test\]" src-tauri/src/ -A 10

# Check UI testing capabilities
ls tests/ui/
rg "playwright|browser" tests/ -A 5

# Examine validation module (priority testing target)
rg "validation::" src-tauri/src/ -A 5
```

**Expected Finding**: Limited test coverage with basic infrastructure but missing comprehensive business logic testing

### 3. Reference-Driven Development
- **Follow testing philosophy** from `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-strategy` - Test our logic, not external libraries
- **Use autonomous UI testing patterns** from `docs/reference/agent-development-tools.md`
- **Build on existing mock infrastructure** in `src/lib/test/fixtures/`
- **Leverage demo mode** for safe UI testing without server connections

### 4. Implementation Strategy Order
**Step 1: Unit Test Coverage Foundation**
- Implement security testing for validation module (malicious inputs, injection prevention)
- Add database transaction safety testing (rollback scenarios, atomic operations)
- Create automation workflow business logic testing (command generation, metadata handling)

**Step 2: Autonomous UI Testing Framework**
- Set up Playwright for headless UI testing in demo mode
- Implement autonomous navigation and interaction testing
- Create visual regression testing with screenshot validation

**Step 3: Test Infrastructure & Automation**
- Enhance CI pipeline with coverage reporting
- Implement performance and reliability testing
- Create test data management and cleanup systems

### Key Technical Decisions Already Made
- **Testing Philosophy** - Focus on business logic, not external dependencies (SSH, SLURM servers)
- **Demo Mode Testing** - Use demo mode for all UI testing to avoid server connections
- **Coverage Requirement** - >80% coverage for critical modules (validation, database, automation)

### Architecture Patterns to Follow
- **NAMDRunner Testing Strategy** - Test our logic, not external libraries like ssh2 or SLURM
- **Autonomous UI Testing** - Playwright-based testing with headless browser configuration
- **Mock-First Development** - Use deterministic mocks, avoid random behavior or server simulation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Constraints & Requirements

### Testing Philosophy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **MUST READ**: `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-strategy` before writing any tests
- **Focus on business logic**: Test NAMDRunner's code, not external libraries (ssh2, SLURM, etc.)
- **No server integration testing**: All tests must work without actual SSH/SLURM connections
- **Deterministic behavior**: No random errors, delays, or "stress testing" in unit tests
- **Fast execution**: Unit tests should complete in <30 seconds total

### UI Testing Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **MUST READ**: `docs/reference/agent-development-tools.md` for autonomous testing capabilities
- **Demo mode only**: All UI testing must use demo mode to avoid server connections
- **Headless configuration**: Must work in SSH environments with proper browser setup
- **Visual validation**: Screenshot capture and comparison for regression testing

### Security Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Test malicious input handling in validation module
- Validate command injection prevention in shell builders
- Test path traversal prevention in file operations
- Ensure transaction rollback works correctly for data safety

### Coverage Requirements
- >80% test coverage for critical modules (validation, database, automation)
- Focus on security-critical code paths and business logic
- Quality over quantity - meaningful tests, not just coverage numbers

## ü§ù Getting Help

### When You Need Guidance
- **Testing strategy questions** - Check `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-strategy` FIRST
- **UI testing questions** - See `docs/reference/agent-development-tools.md` for Playwright patterns
- **Coverage questions** - Focus on validation, database, and automation modules
- **Architecture decisions** - Review `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and ask for input

### Communication Protocol
- **Present your testing plan** before implementing comprehensive test suites
- **Ask specific questions** about testing patterns rather than general approaches
- **Update coverage reports** as you implement tests
- **Share test failures** with concrete examples and error messages

## üéØ Your First Steps

1. **Read all required documentation** - especially testing strategy and agent development tools
2. **Run investigation commands** to understand current test coverage and infrastructure
3. **Analyze existing test patterns** in `tests/` and `src-tauri/src/` directories
4. **Plan your testing approach** focusing on business logic validation
5. **Implement security testing first** for validation module (highest priority)
6. **Get approval for your testing strategy** before writing comprehensive test suites

## Success Metrics
- >80% unit test coverage achieved for critical modules
- Autonomous UI testing framework functional in demo mode
- All existing tests continue passing with new test additions
- Test suite runs efficiently (<30 seconds for unit tests)
- Performance and security validation testing implemented
- Clean, maintainable test code following project standards

## Task Management (CRITICAL)
- **Work from active task** in `tasks/active/phase-6-4-comprehensive-testing.md`
- **Update ARCHITECTURE.md** as you implement testing infrastructure
- **Focus on business logic testing** as defined in NAMDRunner testing philosophy
- **Use demo mode exclusively** for UI testing to avoid server dependencies

Remember: This builds on the clean, secure codebase from Phase 6.3. **Follow NAMDRunner testing philosophy** and **focus on business logic validation** rather than external system integration testing.
