# NAMDRunner Development Roadmap

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Updates**: When completing milestones, always update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect the actual implementation. Architecture doc describes what IS built, this roadmap describes what WILL be built.

## Development Strategy
Build a **single-job MVP first** that handles the core workflow: create job ‚Üí submit ‚Üí track ‚Üí view results.

**Key Design Decision**: Job persistence and discovery are built from Phase 2, not added later. This ensures:
- Test jobs persist between development sessions for proper testing
- No accumulation of "phantom" test data on cluster
- Status sync works from first job submission
- Developers can easily manage and clean up test jobs

**Breaking Changes Policy**: Breaking changes are acceptable and expected during all development phases. Each phase can modify, improve, or completely rewrite previous implementations. No backwards compatibility is required with:
- Previous development phases
- Python reference implementation
- Earlier iterations of schemas or interfaces
- Test data or mock implementations

## Current Status: Phase 5 Complete ‚úÖ

**Phase 3 Skipped**: UI development is being handled in a separate branch.

**Next Priority**: Phase 6 - Single-Job MVP Completion (testing, polish, and production readiness)

**Current Implementation**: See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed description of what exists now, including module structure, SSH/SFTP integration, and security implementation.
