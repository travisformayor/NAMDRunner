# NAMDRunner Development Roadmap

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Updates**: When completing milestones, always update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect the actual implementation. Architecture doc describes what IS built, this roadmap describes what WILL be built.

## Development Strategy
Build a **single-job MVP first** that handles the core workflow: create job ‚Üí submit ‚Üí track ‚Üí view results.

**Key Design Decision**: Job persistence and discovery are built from Phase 2, not added later. This ensures:
- Test jobs persist between development sessions for proper testing
- No accumulation of "phantom" test data on cluster
- Status sync works from first job submission
- Developers can easily manage and clean up test jobs

**Breaking Changes Policy**: Breaking changes are acceptable and expected during all development phases. Each phase can modify, improve, or completely rewrite previous implementations. No backwards compatibility is required with:
- Previous development phases
- Earlier iterations of schemas or interfaces
- Test data or mock implementations

## Current Status: Phase 5 Complete ‚úÖ

**Next Priority**: Phase 6 - Single-Job MVP Completion (testing, polish, and production readiness)

**Current Implementation**: See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed description of what exists now, including module structure, SSH/SFTP integration, and security implementation.

## Phase 7: Production Hardening & Advanced Features

### Milestone 7.1: Request Rate Limiting & Queue Management

**Goal:** Prevent cluster abuse and provide graceful degradation under load

**Current State:**
- Mutex serialization provides implicit rate limiting (one request at a time)
- Single SSH connection physically prevents parallel spam
- No queue depth limits or time-based throttling
- Adequate for MVP testing, but needs hardening for production

**Implementation:**
- [ ] **Rate Limiter Module** (`src-tauri/src/ssh/rate_limiter.rs`)
  - [ ] Configurable requests per second limit (default: 5/sec)
  - [ ] Configurable max queue depth (default: 20 pending requests)
  - [ ] Time-based throttling with token bucket algorithm
  - [ ] Integrates with existing ConnectionManager mutex

- [ ] **Request Deduplication**
  - [ ] Debounce rapid duplicate requests (same command within 1s)
  - [ ] Coalesce multiple identical sync requests into single execution
  - [ ] Track in-flight request signatures to prevent duplicates

- [ ] **Queue Depth Protection**
  - [ ] Reject new requests when queue depth exceeded
  - [ ] Return descriptive error: "Too many pending requests, try again in a moment"
  - [ ] User-facing popup notification via Tauri event system
  - [ ] Log queue depth metrics for monitoring

**Architecture Pattern:**
```rust
// Wrap existing mutex with rate limiter
pub async fn execute_command(&self, command: &str, timeout: Option<u64>) -> Result<CommandResult> {
    self.rate_limiter.wait_for_slot().await?;     // NEW: Rate limit + queue check
    let conn = self.connection.lock().await;       // EXISTING: Mutex serialization
    // ... existing command execution
}
```

**Why:**
- Prevents accidental bugs from DOS'ing cluster, but we dont want that event to silently fail so report it in the SSH Console.
