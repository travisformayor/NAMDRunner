# NAMDRunner Development Roadmap

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Updates**: When completing milestones, always update `docs/architecture.md` to reflect the actual implementation. Architecture doc describes what IS built, this roadmap describes what WILL be built.

## Development Strategy
Build a **single-job MVP first** that handles the core workflow: create job ‚Üí submit ‚Üí track ‚Üí view results. 

**Key Design Decision**: Job persistence and discovery are built from Phase 2, not added later. This ensures:
- Test jobs persist between development sessions for proper testing
- No accumulation of "phantom" test data on cluster
- Status sync works from first job submission
- Developers can easily manage and clean up test jobs

## Current Status: Phase 2 Milestone 2.2 Complete ‚úÖ

**Next Priority**: Milestone 2.3 (Job Status Synchronization) - Build job status tracking and synchronization with SLURM queue state.

**Current Implementation**: See [`docs/architecture.md`](../docs/architecture.md) for detailed description of what exists now, including module structure, SSH/SFTP integration, and security implementation.

## Risk Mitigation

1. **MVP Focus**: Get single-job workflow working before adding complexity
2. **Future-Ready Architecture**: Design data models to support job groups later
3. **Security**: Regular security audits, never log credentials
4. **Windows Compatibility**: Test early and often on Windows
