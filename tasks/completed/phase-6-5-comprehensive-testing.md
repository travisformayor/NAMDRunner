# Task: Phase 6.5 - Comprehensive Testing

## Objective
Implement comprehensive testing coverage (>80%) with unit tests, interactive UI validation in demo mode, and automated test infrastructure to ensure production readiness of the NAMDRunner single-job MVP.

## Context
- **Starting state**: Production-quality codebase with resolved security/quality issues from Phase 6.3, all automation chains working correctly, but lacking comprehensive test coverage
- **Delivered state**: >80% test coverage with unit tests focused on business logic, interactive UI testing framework for autonomous validation, and automated testing infrastructure ready for production deployment
- **Foundation**: Clean, refactored codebase from Phase 6.3 with eliminated anti-patterns, centralized validation, and proper security measures
- **Dependencies**: Phase 6.3 code quality improvements completed, review-refactor agent analysis confirming security and maintainability
- **Testing approach**: Aligns with NAMDRunner's 3-tier testing strategy as outlined in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-strategy` - focusing on business logic testing without external dependency mocking

## Implementation Plan

### Critical Priority (Testing Infrastructure & Coverage)

- [ ] **Unit Test Coverage for Core Modules**
  - [ ] Achieve >80% test coverage for `src-tauri/src/validation.rs` module:
    - [ ] Input validation security tests (malicious inputs, injection attempts)
    - [ ] Shell command safety tests (escaping, safe builders)
    - [ ] File validation tests (type checking, size limits, security)
    - [ ] Path validation tests (traversal prevention, sanitization)
  - [ ] Database transaction testing in `src-tauri/src/database/mod.rs`:
    - [ ] Transaction rollback scenarios (automatic and explicit)
    - [ ] Atomic operations testing (job creation, deletion)
    - [ ] Concurrent access patterns
    - [ ] Data integrity validation
  - [ ] Automation workflow testing in `src-tauri/src/automations/*.rs`:
    - [ ] Job creation workflow validation (business logic only)
    - [ ] Job submission workflow validation (command generation, metadata)
    - [ ] Job completion workflow validation (file preservation logic)
    - [ ] Error handling and recovery scenarios
  - [ ] SLURM command generation testing in `src-tauri/src/slurm/commands.rs`:
    - [ ] Command template generation (no actual SLURM execution)
    - [ ] Parameter escaping and validation
    - [ ] Configuration management testing

- [ ] **Frontend Unit Tests for Business Logic**
  - [ ] Job store business logic (`src/lib/stores/jobs.ts`):
    - [ ] State management validation

  - [ ] Implement autonomous UI validation suite:
    - [ ] Demo mode navigation testing (all pages accessible)
    - [ ] Form interaction testing (fill out job creation form)
    - [ ] Job workflow testing (create → submit → track → view results in demo mode)
    - [ ] Error scenario testing (invalid inputs, connection failures)
    - [ ] Theme switching validation (light/dark themes)
  - [ ] Create headless UI testing framework:
    - [ ] Automated clicking and form filling
    - [ ] Visual regression testing with screenshots
    - [ ] State validation across UI workflows
    - [ ] Performance testing (load times, responsiveness)

- [ ] **Demo Mode Testing Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Enhanced demo mode testing capabilities:
    - [ ] Complete job lifecycle testing without server connections

    - [ ] Test data consistency across UI components
    - [ ] Validate mock API responses match real API contracts
    - [ ] Error simulation testing (network failures, auth failures)

### Medium Priority (Test Infrastructure & Automation)

- [ ] **Testing Automation & CI Integration**
  - [ ] Enhance CI test pipeline:
    - [ ] Automated unit test execution on all commits
    - [ ] Test coverage reporting and enforcement (>80% requirement)

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why Focus on Business Logic Testing
- **Reasoning**: NAMDRunner's testing philosophy emphasizes testing our logic, not external libraries (ssh2, SLURM, etc.)
- **Alternatives considered**: Integration testing with real servers (too complex, unreliable for development)
- **Trade-offs**: Focus on fast, reliable tests over comprehensive system integration

### Why Autonomous UI Testing with Playwright
- **Reasoning**: Enables self-validation by clicking through UI like a user would, particularly valuable for agent development
- **Integration**: Builds on existing agent debug toolkit infrastructure from `docs/reference/agent-development-tools.md`
- **Requirements**: Must work in demo mode to avoid actual server connections during testing

### Why >80% Coverage Requirement
- **Reasoning**: Ensures production readiness and confidence in security/reliability improvements from Phase 6.3
- **Focus areas**: Validation, security, transaction safety, and business logic - the areas most critical for user safety
- **Trade-offs**: Quality over quantity - focus on meaningful tests rather than achieving 100% coverage

## Integration with Existing Code

### Leverage Existing Patterns
- **Use existing mock infrastructure**: Build on `src/lib/test/fixtures/` and demo mode
- **Follow testing patterns**: Align with established Vitest and Playwright patterns in project
- **Apply security testing**: Use validation functions from Phase 6.3 refactoring for security test scenarios

### Where to Hook In
```rust
// Testing patterns to implement
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    // Security validation tests
    #[test]
    fn test_malicious_input_handling() { /* ... */ }

    // Transaction safety tests
    #[test]
    fn test_transaction_rollback() { /* ... */ }

    // Business logic tests
    #[test]
    fn test_job_workflow_validation() { /* ... */ }
}
```

```typescript
// UI testing patterns to implement
describe('Job Creation Workflow', () => {
  test('complete job creation in demo mode', async () => {
    // Autonomous UI testing using Playwright
  });
});
```

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should we implement visual regression testing for UI components?
- [ ] Do we need performance benchmarking as part of the test suite?
- [ ] Should test coverage requirements vary by module criticality?
- [ ] How should we handle test data cleanup between test runs?
