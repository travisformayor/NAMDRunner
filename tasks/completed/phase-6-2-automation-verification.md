# Task: Phase 6.2 Automation Chain Verification

## Objective
Verify and complete all automation chains in the NAMDRunner job lifecycle (creation, submission, status sync, completion, cleanup) to ensure proper workflow separation, implementation completeness, and end-to-end functionality.

## Context
- **Starting state**: Phase 6.1 complete with stable UI-backend integration and SSH connections, but job automation chains need implementation and verification
- **Delivered state**: All automation chains verified working correctly with complete job lifecycle from creation through completion and cleanup, including automation architecture foundation
- **Foundation**: Stable UI-backend integration from Phase 6.1, existing SSH/SFTP/SLURM infrastructure
- **Dependencies**: Phase 6.1 UI-backend integration (complete), existing SSH/SFTP/SLURM infrastructure (complete)
- **Testing approach**: Manual verification of each automation chain, integration testing of complete workflows, follows NAMDRunner testing philosophy with both demo and real modes

## Implementation Plan

### Critical Priority (Blockers)

- [ ] **Job Creation Automation Verification**
  - [ ] Verify job creation only creates project directories (not scratch directories)
  - [ ] Validate integrated file upload during creation process works atomically
  - [ ] Test progress tracking events are emitted correctly to UI
  - [ ] Confirm database persistence saves job with "CREATED" status
  - [ ] Verify security validation (input sanitization, path safety) works correctly

- [ ] **Job Submission Automation Implementation & Verification**
  - [ ] Implement missing `execute_job_submission_with_progress` automation function
  - [ ] Create scratch directories during submission (not creation)
  - [ ] Copy files from project directory to scratch directory
  - [ ] Generate and submit SLURM job script
  - [ ] Update job status to "SUBMITTED" with SLURM job ID
  - [ ] Test progress tracking throughout submission process

### High Priority (Core Functionality)

- [ ] **Status Synchronization Verification**
  - [ ] Test `sync_job_status` command works correctly for individual jobs
  - [ ] Verify `sync_all_jobs` batch operation functions properly
  - [ ] Validate status transitions (PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED)
  - [ ] Confirm database updates include proper timestamps
  - [ ] Test error handling for jobs without SLURM IDs

- [ ] **Job Completion & Results Automation Implementation**
  - [ ] Implement `execute_job_completion_with_progress` automation function
  - [ ] Detect when jobs change to COMPLETED status
  - [ ] Copy critical output files from scratch to project directory
  - [ ] Create structured results directory: `/projects/$USER/namdrunner_jobs/{job_id}/results/`
  - [ ] Preserve NAMD trajectory files (.dcd, .coor, .vel, .xsc)
  - [ ] Preserve SLURM output logs (.out, .err files)
  - [ ] Preserve NAMD simulation logs and energy files

- [ ] **Job Cleanup Verification**
  - [ ] Test safe directory deletion with multiple validation layers
  - [ ] Verify both project and scratch directory cleanup works
  - [ ] Confirm security protections prevent path traversal attacks
  - [ ] Test database cleanup integration
  - [ ] Validate error handling for connection failures

### Medium Priority (Enhancements)

- [ ] **End-to-End Workflow Testing**
  - [ ] Test complete workflow: create → submit → monitor → complete → cleanup
  - [ ] Verify workflow separation maintains proper boundaries
  - [ ] Test error recovery at each stage
  - [ ] Validate UI feedback and progress tracking throughout

- [ ] **Documentation & Integration**
  - [ ] Update `docs/AUTOMATIONS.md` with any implementation changes
  - [ ] Ensure automation functions follow established patterns
  - [ ] Verify integration with existing error handling and retry logic
  - [ ] Document any new automation chains discovered during verification

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- [ ] Job creation automation creates only project directories with proper file upload
- [ ] Job submission automation creates scratch directories and submits to SLURM
- [ ] Status synchronization correctly updates job states from SLURM
- [ ] Job completion automation preserves critical results before scratch cleanup
- [ ] Job cleanup automation safely removes directories with security validation

### Technical Success
- [ ] All automation functions follow simple async function pattern with progress callbacks
- [ ] Tauri event emission provides real-time UI feedback
- [ ] Database operations maintain consistency throughout workflow
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages failures at each stage
- [ ] Security validation prevents malicious input at all automation steps

### Quality Success
- [ ] Complete job lifecycle works end-to-end in both demo and real modes
- [ ] Progress tracking provides clear user feedback for all operations
- [ ] Workflow separation maintains proper boundaries between automation stages
- [ ] All automation chains integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects implemented automation behavior

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why Implement Job Submission as Separate Automation
- **Reasoning**: Maintains proper workflow separation established in Phase 6.1 - creation sets up project, submission handles execution
- **Implementation**: Create `execute_job_submission_with_progress` following same pattern as job creation
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, atomic operations, proper progress tracking
- **Result**: Users can create jobs without immediately submitting, proper workflow boundaries

### Why Add Job Completion Automation
- **Reasoning**: Scratch directories are temporary - need to preserve important results before cleanup
- **Implementation**: Detect completed jobs and copy critical files to permanent project directory
- **Benefits**: Users don't lose simulation results, automatic preservation, structured results storage
- **Result**: Important output files survive cluster cleanup policies

### Why Enhance Existing Cleanup Instead of Rewriting
- **Reasoning**: Current delete_job implementation has comprehensive security validation already
- **Implementation**: Verify existing implementation follows automation patterns, enhance if needed
- **Benefits**: Maintains security patterns, avoids regression, leverages existing validation
- **Result**: Safe cleanup with proven security protections

## Integration with Existing Code

### Leverage Existing Patterns
- **Use Automation Architecture**: Follow `execute_job_creation_with_progress` pattern for new automation functions
- **Follow Progress Callback Pattern**: Use `move |msg| { let _ = handle_clone.emit(event_name, msg); }` for UI feedback
- **Apply Security Validation**: Use existing `sanitize_job_id`, path safety, and input validation patterns

### Where to Hook In
```rust
// Existing functions to enhance
src-tauri/src/commands/jobs.rs::submit_job_real() // Add: automation function integration
src-tauri/src/commands/jobs.rs::sync_job_status() // Verify: proper automation pattern adherence
src-tauri/src/commands/jobs.rs::delete_job_real() // Verify: security validation completeness

// New functions to add
src-tauri/src/automations/job_submission.rs::execute_job_submission_with_progress() // Purpose: submit job with scratch setup
src-tauri/src/automations/job_completion.rs::execute_job_completion_with_progress() // Purpose: preserve results after completion
```

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should job completion automation be triggered automatically on status change or manually by user?
- [ ] What is the optimal retry strategy for automation functions that fail partway through?
- [ ] Should automation progress events include estimated completion times?
