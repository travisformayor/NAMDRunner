# Phase 1 Milestone 1.3: Connection Architecture Implementation

## Mission: Establish Connection Architecture Foundation

You are implementing **Phase 1 Milestone 1.3** of NAMDRunner, building the connection architecture and interface definitions that will support secure SSH/SFTP connectivity to SLURM clusters. This is **architecture work** - you're defining interfaces, patterns, and mock implementations, not building actual SSH connections yet.

## üéØ Core Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Connection Interface Design** - Define clean, testable interfaces for SSH/SFTP operations
2. **State Management Architecture** - Robust connection state transitions and persistence
3. **Error Handling Strategy** - Comprehensive, user-friendly error management system
4. **Remote Directory Patterns** - Consistent directory structure and path management
5. **Validation Framework** - Connection testing and validation utilities

### Success Definition
By completion, the project should have:
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for all connection operations
- Observable connection state management working with mocks
- Comprehensive error handling with actionable user guidance
- Well-defined remote directory structure patterns
- Enhanced mock system supporting all new connection patterns

## üó∫Ô∏è Implementation Approach

### Phase A: Interface Design (Priority 1)
**Goal**: Define clean, comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

#### A1. Connection Core Interfaces
```typescript
// Focus: src/lib/types/connection.ts
- SSHConnection interface with all operations
- SFTPConnection interface for file operations  
- ConnectionStateManager for state transitions
- SessionManager for persistence and recovery
```

**Key Design Principles**:
- **Dependency injection ready** - All interfaces should be mockable
- **Observable patterns** - State changes must be observable for UI
- **Error-first design** - Every operation returns Result<T, Error> patterns
- **Future-proof** - Design for extensibility without breaking changes

#### A2. Error Handling Architecture
```typescript
// Focus: src/lib/types/errors.ts  
- ConnectionError with categories and recovery hints
- ErrorRecoveryStrategy for different error types
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
```

**Critical Requirements**:
- Categorized errors (Network, Auth, Timeout, Permission)
- Actionable user guidance for every error type
- Retry strategies with exponential backoff
- No sensitive information exposed in error messages

### Phase B: State Management (Priority 2)
**Goal**: Robust connection state with clear transitions

#### B1. Connection State Machine
```typescript
// Focus: src/lib/services/connectionState.ts
- ConnectionState enum with all possible states
- State transition validation and logging
- Observable state changes for UI integration
- Persistence across application restarts
```

#### B2. Session Management
```typescript
// Focus: src/lib/services/sessionManager.ts  
- Session validation and expiration handling
- Secure session persistence (no credentials stored)
- Automatic session refresh scheduling
- Clean session cleanup on disconnect
```

### Phase C: Directory & Validation (Priority 3) 
**Goal**: Consistent remote directory patterns and validation

#### C1. Remote Directory Management
```typescript
// Focus: src/lib/services/directoryManager.ts
- Standardized path generation functions
- Directory setup and validation utilities
- Job workspace organization patterns
- Cleanup and maintenance operations
```

#### C2. Connection Validation Framework
```typescript
// Focus: src/lib/services/connectionValidator.ts
- Multi-stage connection validation
- SSH and SFTP capability testing
- SLURM access verification
- Comprehensive validation reporting
```

### Phase D: Enhanced Mocks (Priority 4)
**Goal**: Update existing mock system to support new patterns

#### D1. Mock State Management
```typescript
// Enhance: src/lib/ports/coreClient-mock.ts
- Realistic connection state transitions
- Error scenario simulation
- Deterministic behavior for tests
- Integration with existing test data manager
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Guidelines

### TypeScript Interface Patterns
```typescript
// Use Result patterns for error handling
type Result<T, E = Error> = { success: true; data: T } | { success: false; error: E };

// Observable patterns for state management  
interface Observable<T> {
  subscribe(observer: (value: T) => void): Unsubscribe;
  getValue(): T;
}

// Dependency injection patterns
interface ConnectionFactory {
  createSSHConnection(config: ConnectionConfig): SSHConnection;
  createSFTPConnection(config: ConnectionConfig): SFTPConnection;
}
```

### State Management Patterns
```typescript
// Clear state machine with validation
class ConnectionStateMachine {
  private validTransitions: Map<ConnectionState, ConnectionState[]>;
  
  canTransition(from: ConnectionState, to: ConnectionState): boolean;
  transition(to: ConnectionState, reason?: string): void;
  onStateChange(callback: (state: ConnectionState) => void): void;
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns  
```typescript
// User-friendly error messages
interface UserError {
  title: string;           // "Connection Failed"
  message: string;         // "Cannot reach cluster host"
  suggestions: string[];   // ["Check network", "Verify host"]
  retryable: boolean;      // Can user retry this operation?
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Focus (Not Implementation)
- **This milestone is about design, not SSH implementation**
- Focus on interfaces, patterns, and architecture decisions
- Mock implementations should be realistic but don't need full SSH logic
- Prepare for Phase 2 SSH implementation without building it

### Technology Constraints (From Phase 1)
- **Password-only SSH** (no key support per cluster requirements)
- **Never persist credentials** (memory only, clear on disconnect)
- **Type-safe IPC boundary** (strict contracts between TS/Rust)
- **Offline-first design** (local SQLite cache, manual sync)

### Connection Security Considerations
- **Never log or persist SSH passwords** - Session tokens only, not credentials  
- **Clear credentials from memory on disconnect** - Implement secure cleanup patterns
- **Error message safety** - No credential leakage in error messages
- **Timeout handling** - All operations must have reasonable timeouts
- **Use minimal Tauri permissions** - Only what's needed for SSH/SFTP
- **Validate all user inputs** - Prevent injection attacks

### Integration with Existing System
- **Extend existing mocks** - Build on `coreClient-mock.ts` patterns
- **Use test data manager** - Integrate with `testDataManager.ts` scenarios
- **Follow IPC patterns** - Match existing TypeScript ‚Üî Rust boundaries
- **Maintain test compatibility** - Don't break existing tests
- **Port/adapter pattern** for external dependencies (SSH, SLURM)
- **Reactive Svelte stores** for session and job state

### Key Technical Decisions Already Made
- **SQLite schema** - Use structure from `docs/data-spec.md`
- **SLURM commands** - Use proven patterns from `docs/reference/slurm-commands-reference.md`
- **Job metadata** - JSON format defined in `tasks/phase1-interface-definitions.md`
- **Directory structure** - `/projects/$USER/namdrunner_jobs/` pattern

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Architecture Antipatterns
- **Don't**: Over-engineer interfaces - keep them focused and simple
- **Don't**: Implement actual SSH operations - this is architecture only
- **Don't**: Create tight coupling between components - use dependency injection
- **Don't**: Ignore error scenarios - design error-first from the beginning

### State Management Issues  
- **Don't**: Create complex state machines - focus on essential states only
- **Don't**: Make state transitions unpredictable - all transitions must be deterministic
- **Don't**: Forget cleanup - all resources must have proper cleanup patterns
- **Don't**: Ignore concurrency - state changes must be thread-safe

### Mock Implementation Problems
- **Don't**: Make mocks too simple - they should catch design issues
- **Don't**: Make mocks too complex - focus on interface validation
- **Don't**: Ignore existing patterns - extend current mock system
- **Don't**: Create inconsistent behavior - mocks should be deterministic

## üìö Implementation Resources

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Testing and validation  
npm run test            # Unit tests
npm run test:ui         # UI integration testing
npm run lint            # Code quality checks
npm run check           # TypeScript validation
```

### When You Need Help
- **SLURM integration questions** - Check `docs/reference/slurm-commands-reference.md` first
- **Data format questions** - See `docs/data-spec.md`
- **Architecture decisions** - Review `docs/architecture.md` and ask for input
- **Python implementation questions** - Look at `docs/reference/python-implementation-reference.md`
- **Read `docs/agent-capabilities.md`** first for complete tooling reference
- **Use investigation tools** - `npm run test:ui` for debugging UI integration  
- **Ask specific questions** rather than general "how do I..." queries

### Task Management (CRITICAL)
- **Create task files** using `tasks/templates/task.md` before coding
- **Work on one task at a time** - move to `tasks/active/` when starting
- **Update architecture.md** as you implement each component
- **Get approval** for your implementation plan before coding
- **Present your plan** before starting major implementation work
- **Update docs** as you learn and implement
- **Share progress updates** with concrete examples

### Quality Requirements
- Comprehensive unit test coverage with mocks (>80%)
- Type safety across the entire IPC boundary
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Follow coding standards in `docs/technical-spec.md`

### Reference Implementation Respect
- Use proven SLURM integration patterns
- Respect working directory structures
- Follow established JSON schemas
- Learn from Python version mistakes

Remember: This is **not a migration** but a **new application with reference implementation**. Use the Python patterns as a starting point, then improve and modernize with Tauri's capabilities.

The comprehensive testing infrastructure is ready to support your development. Focus on clean architecture and the SSH implementation in Phase 2 will build smoothly on your foundation!

Good luck! üçÄ
