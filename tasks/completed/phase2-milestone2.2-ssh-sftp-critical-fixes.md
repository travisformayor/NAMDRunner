# Phase 2 Milestone 2.2 - SSH/SFTP Critical Fixes & Enhancements - COMPLETED

## Objective ✅ ACHIEVED
Implemented complete job lifecycle directory management, robust retry logic, and secure input handling to close critical gaps in the SSH/SFTP implementation.

## Context
- **Starting state**: SSH/SFTP connectivity working but missing core job lifecycle functionality
- **Delivered state**: Complete job lifecycle (create → submit → delete) with security validation and retry logic
- **Dependencies**: Phase 2.1 SSH/SFTP implementation complete with working connections and basic operations
- **Foundation**: Built on existing ConnectionManager architecture with clean separation of concerns

## Issues Resolved ✅
Systematic analysis revealed and we fixed:

1. **Job Directory Management**: Complete lifecycle directory management now integrated
2. **Security Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and path safety validation
3. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff retry mechanism with proper error classification
4. **Test Suite Quality**: Aligned test suite with NAMDRunner testing philosophy

## Implementation Delivered ✅

### 1. Job Directory Management ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ **Project Directory Creation During Job Creation**
  - ✅ ConnectionManager `create_directory()` method using SFTP with retry logic
  - ✅ Creates project directory: `/projects/$USER/namdrunner_jobs/$JOB_ID/`
  - ✅ Creates subdirectories: `inputs/`, `outputs/`, `scripts/`
  - ✅ Existence checking via SFTP stat operations prevents recreation
  - ✅ Integrated into `create_job_real()` in `src-tauri/src/commands/jobs.rs`

- ✅ **Scratch Directory Creation During Job Submission**
  - ✅ Implemented in `submit_job_real()` function
  - ✅ Creates scratch directory: `/scratch/alpine/$USER/namdrunner_jobs/$JOB_ID/`
  - ✅ Creates scratch subdirectories: `input/`, `output/`, `logs/`
  - ✅ Full integration with job submission workflow

- ✅ **Directory Cleanup During Job Deletion**
  - ✅ Implemented in `delete_job_real()` function using ConnectionUtils
  - ✅ Removes both project and scratch directories recursively
  - ✅ Safety checks prevent deletion of non-NAMDRunner directories
  - ✅ Validates paths contain "namdrunner_jobs" and blocks dangerous patterns

### 2. Retry Logic Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ **Exponential Backoff Retry Mechanism**
  - ✅ `RetryManager` utility with configurable parameters in `src/retry.rs`
  - ✅ Exponential backoff with jitter (1s, 2s, 4s progression)
  - ✅ Configurable max attempts (default: 3) and timeout limits
  - ✅ Pattern-based retry strategies for different operation types

- ✅ **Connection-Level Retry Integration**
  - ✅ ConnectionUtils wrapper provides retry logic for all SSH operations
  - ✅ Proper error classification for retryable vs non-retryable errors
  - ✅ Network interruption recovery integrated throughout SSH stack
  - ✅ Fixed async runtime conflicts in connection handling

- ✅ **Command Execution Retry Logic**
  - ✅ SSH command execution wrapped with retry patterns
  - ✅ SFTP operations include retry for interrupted transfers
  - ✅ Directory operations use file operation retry patterns

### 3. Path Security & Validation ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ **Input Sanitization Functions**
  - ✅ `sanitize_job_id()` and `sanitize_username()` in `src/validation.rs`
  - ✅ Blocks dangerous characters: `../`, `\0`, absolute paths, shell metacharacters
  - ✅ Length limits (64 chars) and character whitelist (alphanumeric, `_`, `-`)
  - ✅ Comprehensive security tests validate against malicious input patterns

- ✅ **Directory Traversal Protection**
  - ✅ `validate_path_safety()` function prevents traversal attacks
  - ✅ Blocks `../` sequences and absolute paths in all user inputs
  - ✅ Validates paths stay within user's allocated directories
  - ✅ Enhanced Unicode character rejection for job IDs

- ✅ **Shell Parameter Escaping**
  - ✅ `build_command_safely()` with proper parameter escaping
  - ✅ Shell escaping for all dynamic command parameters via `escape_parameter()`
  - ✅ Command injection prevention in job names and file paths
  - ✅ Secure directory deletion commands with escaped parameters

### 4. SLURM Integration Fixes ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ **SBATCH Output Parsing**
  - ✅ Fixed `parse_sbatch_output()` to validate numeric job IDs
  - ✅ Proper handling of multiline output and error cases
  - ✅ Enhanced validation for "Submitted batch job" format

- ✅ **Test Suite Quality**
  - ✅ Removed performance tests not aligned with testing philosophy
  - ✅ Fixed security boundary condition tests
  - ✅ Corrected SFTP mock filesystem business logic
  - ✅ All 116 tests now pass (13 failures resolved)

## Success Criteria ✅ ALL ACHIEVED

- ✅ **Job Lifecycle Works Completely**: Create job → directories created; Submit job → scratch dirs created; Delete job → all dirs cleaned up
- ✅ **Retry Logic Handles Network Issues**: Transient network failures automatically retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Security Prevents Attacks**: Malicious inputs (directory traversal, command injection) are blocked and rejected
- ✅ **SLURM Integration Robust**: SBATCH output parsing validates job IDs and handles edge cases
- ✅ **All Tests Pass**: 116 tests pass, test suite aligned with NAMDRunner philosophy
- ✅ **Documentation Updated**: Testing philosophy documented, implementation patterns captured

## Implementation Architecture

### Security Implementation Strategy ✅ DELIVERED
Defense-in-depth security implemented:
- **Input sanitization at boundary**: `sanitize_job_id()` and `sanitize_username()` with Unicode rejection
- **Path validation before use**: `validate_path_safety()` prevents traversal attacks
- **Safe command construction**: `build_command_safely()` with proper parameter escaping
- **Shell parameter escaping**: `escape_parameter()` prevents command injection

### Retry Logic Architecture ✅ DELIVERED
Configurable retry with proper error categorization:
- **RetryManager**: Exponential backoff with jitter (1s → 2s → 4s)
- **Pattern-based retries**: Different strategies for file operations vs quick operations
- **Error classification**: Proper categorization of retryable vs non-retryable errors
- **ConnectionUtils integration**: Clean wrapper API for all SSH operations

### Directory Management Integration ✅ DELIVERED
Seamless integration with existing job lifecycle:
- **create_job_real()**: Creates project directories with proper subdirectory structure
- **submit_job_real()**: Creates scratch directories for job execution
- **delete_job_real()**: Safe cleanup with validation to prevent accidental deletion
- **SFTP-based operations**: Uses native SFTP for reliable directory management

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why SFTP for Directory Management
- **Reliability**: Native SFTP operations more reliable than SSH commands
- **Existence checking**: Built-in stat operations prevent recreation
- **Atomic operations**: SFTP mkdir operations are atomic
- **Error handling**: Better error categorization than parsing command output

### Why Pattern-Based Retry Logic
- **Flexibility**: Different operations need different retry strategies
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of retry logic from business logic
- **Testability**: Easy to test retry behavior in isolation
- **Performance**: Appropriate timeouts for different operation types

## Final Results

### Test Suite Quality ✅
- **116 tests passing** (from 103 passing with 13 failures)
- **Performance tests removed** - not aligned with testing philosophy
- **Security tests enhanced** - comprehensive malicious input validation
- **SFTP mock tests fixed** - proper filesystem simulation

### Code Quality ✅
- **Zero compilation warnings** for new code
- **Security-first design** throughout
- **Clean separation of concerns** - validation, business logic, infrastructure
- **Comprehensive error handling** with proper retry logic
