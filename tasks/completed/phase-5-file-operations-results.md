# Task: Phase 5 - File Operations & Results Management ✅ COMPLETED

## Objective
Complete backend file operations infrastructure to enable end-to-end job workflow with real file upload/download, results browsing, and job cleanup functionality.

## Context
- **Starting state**: Mock file upload/download operations, SLURM integration complete, job lifecycle working, SSH/SFTP infrastructure with retry logic established
- **Delivered state**: Real SFTP file operations, directory listing for results, log aggregation, job cleanup with remote directory removal, complete backend ready for UI integration
- **Foundation**: Phase 2 SSH/SFTP infrastructure, Phase 4 SLURM integration, database persistence, retry logic patterns, and secure command execution
- **Dependencies**: SSH connection working, job directory management operational, SLURM job submission functional
- **Testing approach**: Business logic unit tests with mocked SFTP operations, integration tests with real cluster when available, security tests for file operation validation, aligned with NAMDRunner testing philosophy

## Final Implementation Architecture

### File Operations Commands (`src/commands/files.rs`)
```rust
// Command handlers using execute_with_mode pattern
pub async fn upload_job_files(job_id: String, files: Vec<FileUpload>) -> UploadResult
pub async fn download_job_output(job_id: String, file_name: String) -> DownloadResult
pub async fn list_job_files(job_id: String) -> ListFilesResult
pub async fn get_job_logs(job_id: String) -> DownloadResult
pub async fn cleanup_job_files(job_id: String) -> DownloadResult

// Real implementations using ConnectionManager and SFTP
async fn upload_job_files_real() // Real SFTP upload with validation
async fn download_job_output_real() // Real SFTP download with multiple path checking
async fn list_job_files_real() // SFTP directory listing with file classification
async fn get_job_logs_real() // SLURM and NAMD log aggregation
async fn cleanup_job_files_real() // Safe remote directory cleanup

// Mock implementations for testing
async fn upload_job_files_mock() // Predictable mock upload behavior
async fn download_job_output_mock() // Simple mock content generation
async fn list_job_files_mock() // Sample file list generation
async fn get_job_logs_mock() // Mock log aggregation
async fn cleanup_job_files_mock() // Mock cleanup simulation
```

### Database Integration (`src/database/`)
```rust
// Direct database access pattern
with_database(|db| db.save_job(job_info))
with_database(|db| db.load_job(job_id))

// Helper functions for common operations
helpers::update_job_with_slurm_id(&mut job_info, slurm_job_id)
helpers::update_job_status_with_timestamps(&mut job_info, status, source)
```

### Mock State Management (`src/mock_state.rs`)
```rust
// Simplified test scenarios
enum TestScenario {
    CleanSlate,          // Empty state
    WithSampleJobs,      // Basic test jobs
    WithActiveJobs,      // Jobs with connection state
}

// Predictable behavior for testing
impl MockStateManager {
    fn should_simulate_error(&self) -> bool { false } // Always predictable
    fn get_delay(&self, operation: &str) -> u64 { /* Fixed delays */ }
    fn generate_slurm_job_id(&self) -> String { /* Sequential IDs */ }
}
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### Direct Database Access Pattern
- **Reasoning**: Repository pattern was a thin wrapper providing no value
- **Implementation**: Use `with_database()` for all database operations
- **Benefits**: Reduced code complexity, eliminated unnecessary abstraction layer

### Unified File Operations in Single Module
- **Reasoning**: File operations are cohesive functionality that belong together
- **Implementation**: Keep all file commands in `src/commands/files.rs` with clear mock/real separation
- **Benefits**: Easy to understand, maintain, and test as a unit

### Simplified Mock State for Predictable Testing
- **Reasoning**: Complex simulation behavior made tests unpredictable and hard to debug
- **Implementation**: Deterministic mock behavior with fixed delays and no random failures
- **Benefits**: Reliable tests, easier debugging, clearer test intentions

## Integration with Existing Code

### Leverages Existing Patterns
- **SSH ConnectionManager**: All SFTP operations use existing connection management
- **Retry Logic**: ConnectionUtils retry mechanisms applied to all file operations
- **Validation**: Existing input sanitization and path security patterns
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error classification and user-friendly messages

### File Operation Flow
```rust
// Upload flow
validate_job_id() → load_job_from_database() → create_input_directory() →
validate_files() → upload_via_sftp() → verify_upload()

// Download flow
validate_job_id() → load_job_from_database() → check_multiple_paths() →
download_via_sftp() → return_content()

// Cleanup flow
validate_job_id() → load_job_from_database() → cleanup_scratch_dir() →
cleanup_project_dir() → verify_cleanup()
```
