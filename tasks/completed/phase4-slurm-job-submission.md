# Task: Complete Phase 4 SLURM Integration - Real Job Submission

## Objective
Enable users to submit NAMD molecular dynamics jobs to real SLURM clusters with generated batch scripts and track their execution through completion.

## Context
- **Starting state**: Mock job submission working with fake SLURM job IDs, complete status tracking system, job lifecycle management, and database persistence
- **Delivered state**: Real SLURM batch script generation and submission, actual job execution on cluster, full end-to-end workflow from job creation to completion
- **Foundation**: Phase 2 SSH/SFTP infrastructure, job status synchronization (`sync_job_status`, `sync_all_jobs`), database persistence, retry logic, and secure command execution
- **Dependencies**: SSH connection working, job directory management operational, status tracking functional
- **Testing approach**: Aligned with NAMDRunner philosophy - business logic unit tests with mocked SLURM commands, integration tests with real cluster when available, security tests for script injection prevention

## Implementation Plan

### Critical Priority (Blockers)

- [ ] **SLURM Batch Script Generation**
  - [ ] Design NAMD script template system with variable substitution
  - [ ] Implement script generation from JobInfo (NAMD config, SLURM config, file paths)
  - [ ] Add security validation for script content (prevent injection attacks)
  - [ ] Create script upload to project directory via existing SFTP infrastructure

- [ ] **Real SLURM Job Submission**
  - [ ] Replace mock submission in `submit_job_real()` with actual sbatch execution
  - [ ] Integrate with existing SSH command execution and retry patterns
  - [ ] Parse real SLURM job IDs from sbatch output (build on existing parsing logic)
  - [ ] Handle SLURM submission errors with proper error classification

### High Priority (Core Functionality)

- [ ] **File Transfer Integration**
  - [ ] Copy input files from project directory to scratch directory before submission
  - [ ] Integrate with existing directory management and SFTP operations
  - [ ] Validate all required files present before job submission

- [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling**
  - [ ] Map SLURM-specific errors (quota exceeded, invalid partition, etc.) to user-friendly messages
  - [ ] Integrate with existing retry logic for transient failures
  - [ ] Add submission validation (check resources against partition limits)

### Medium Priority (Enhancements)

- [ ] **Script Template Optimization**
  - [ ] Support multiple NAMD versions (namd2 vs namd3) based on cluster detection
  - [ ] Add configurable module loading (build on existing module load patterns)
  - [ ] Template validation and syntax checking

- [ ] **Job Monitoring Enhancements**
  - [ ] Improve status sync frequency for recently submitted jobs
  - [ ] Add submission timestamp tracking and queue time calculation

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- [ ] User can create job, submit to real SLURM cluster, and track execution to completion
- [ ] Generated SLURM scripts are valid and execute NAMD jobs correctly
- [ ] Job status updates reflect real cluster state (PENDING â†’ RUNNING â†’ COMPLETED/FAILED)

### Technical Success
- [ ] SLURM script generation follows cluster security requirements (no injection vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Integration with existing SSH/SFTP infrastructure seamless (no code duplication)
- [ ] Error handling provides actionable feedback for submission failures

### Quality Success
- [ ] All existing tests continue passing with new submission logic
- [ ] New SLURM script generation has comprehensive unit tests with mocked cluster responses
- [ ] Security tests validate script injection prevention

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why Template-Based Script Generation
- **Reasoning**: Provides flexibility for different NAMD job types while maintaining security through controlled variable substitution
- **Alternatives considered**: Hardcoded script strings (not flexible), complex script builders (over-engineered)
- **Trade-offs**: Simple templates vs. advanced features - optimizing for maintainability and security

### Why Integrate with Existing Job Lifecycle
- **Reasoning**: Leverages battle-tested directory management, status sync, and database persistence
- **Integration**: Enhance existing `submit_job_real()` function rather than creating parallel submission path
- **Benefits**: Maintains consistency with established patterns and error handling

### Why Build on Existing SSH Infrastructure
- **Reasoning**: SSH command execution, retry logic, and SFTP operations already working and tested
- **Alternatives considered**: New SLURM-specific connection handling (duplicates functionality)
- **Trade-offs**: Reuse vs. custom optimization - prioritizing reliability and consistency

## Integration with Existing Code

### Leverage Existing Patterns
- **Use SSH ConnectionManager**: Build script upload and sbatch execution on existing command patterns
- **Follow JobRepository patterns**: Extend existing job persistence for submission metadata
- **Apply existing validation**: Use established input sanitization and path security

### Where to Hook In
```rust
// Existing functions to enhance (don't rebuild)
submit_job_real() // Add: actual SLURM script generation and sbatch execution
create_job_real() // Add: validate SLURM config against templates

// New functions to add (follow established patterns)
generate_slurm_script() // Create batch script from JobInfo using template system
upload_and_submit_job() // Upload script and execute sbatch with existing retry logic
validate_slurm_config() // Check resource requirements against cluster limits
```

- [ ] Should we support multiple template formats or start with a single general-purpose template?
- [ ] What cluster-specific module loading patterns need to be configurable vs hardcoded?
