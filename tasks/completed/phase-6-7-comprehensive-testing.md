# Task: Phase 6.7 - Comprehensive Testing

## Objective
Implement comprehensive testing coverage (>80%) with unit tests, interactive UI validation in demo mode, and automated test infrastructure to ensure production readiness of the NAMDRunner single-job MVP.

## Context
- **Starting state**: Production-quality codebase with resolved security/quality issues from Phase 6.3, all automation chains working correctly, but lacking comprehensive test coverage
- **Goal state**: >80% test coverage with a strong focus on business logic, autonomous UI validation, and reliable automated infrastructure for production deployment
- **Foundation**: Clean, refactored codebase from Phase 6.3 with eliminated anti-patterns, centralized validation, and proper security measures
- **Dependencies**: Phase 6 code quality improvements completed, review-refactor agent analysis for security/maintainability
- **Testing approach**: Aligns with NAMDRunner's 3-tier testing strategy as outlined in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-strategy` – focusing on business logic testing without external dependency mocking

**Note:** Before marking this phase complete, we need to evaluate all changes made in the task plans for phases 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6, and verify if any additional testing work remains as a result of those iterations. This check is still pending and must be performed.

## Implementation Plan

### Critical Priority (Testing Infrastructure & Coverage)

- [ ] **Unit Test Coverage for Core Modules**
  - [ ] Achieve >80% test coverage for `src-tauri/src/validation.rs` module:
    - [ ] Input validation security tests (malicious inputs, injection attempts)
    - [ ] Shell command safety tests (escaping, safe builders)
    - [ ] File validation tests (type checking, size limits, security)
    - [ ] Path validation tests (traversal prevention, sanitization)
  - [ ] Database transaction testing in `src-tauri/src/database/mod.rs`:
    - [ ] Transaction rollback scenarios (automatic and explicit)
    - [ ] Atomic operations testing (job creation, deletion)
    - [ ] Concurrent access patterns
    - [ ] Data integrity validation
  - [ ] Automation workflow testing in `src-tauri/src/automations/*.rs`:
    - [ ] Job creation workflow validation (business logic only)
    - [ ] Job submission workflow validation (command generation, metadata)
    - [ ] Job completion workflow validation (file preservation logic)
    - [ ] Error handling and recovery scenarios
  - [ ] SLURM command generation testing in `src-tauri/src/slurm/commands.rs`:

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why Focus on Business Logic Testing
- **Reasoning**: NAMDRunner's testing philosophy emphasizes testing our logic, not external libraries (ssh2, SLURM, etc.)
- **Alternatives considered**: Integration testing with real servers (too complex, unreliable for development)
- **Trade-offs**: Focus on fast, reliable tests over comprehensive system integration

### Why Autonomous UI Testing with Playwright
- **Reasoning**: Enables self-validation by clicking through UI like a user would, particularly valuable for agent development
- **Integration**: Builds on existing agent debug toolkit infrastructure from `docs/reference/agent-development-tools.md`
- **Requirements**: Must work in demo mode to avoid actual server connections during testing

### Why >80% Coverage Requirement
- **Reasoning**: Ensures production readiness and confidence in security/reliability improvements from Phase 6.3
- **Focus areas**: Validation, security, transaction safety, and business logic - the areas most critical for user safety
- **Trade-offs**: Quality over quantity - focus on meaningful tests rather than achieving 100% coverage

## Integration with Existing Code

### Leverage Existing Patterns
- **Use existing mock infrastructure**: Build on `src/lib/test/fixtures/` and demo mode
- **Follow testing patterns**: Align with established Vitest and Playwright patterns in project
- **Apply security testing**: Use validation functions from Phase 6.3 refactoring for security test scenarios

### Where to Hook In
```rust
// Testing patterns to implement
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    // Security validation tests
    #[test]
    fn test_malicious_input_handling() { /* ... */ }

    // Transaction safety tests
    #[test]
    fn test_transaction_rollback() { /* ... */ }

    // Business logic tests
    #[test]
    fn test_job_workflow_validation() { /* ... */ }
}
```

```typescript
// UI testing patterns to implement
describe('Job Creation Workflow', () => {
  test('complete job creation in demo mode', async () => {
    // Autonomous UI testing using Playwright
  });
});
```

<!-- These completion checks remain TODO until final review of prior phases' impact -->

## Implementation Summary (So Far)
- Ongoing: Security, business logic, and UI testing infrastructure being implemented
- Ongoing: Test automation, CI pipeline integration, frontend and backend test coverage
- Business logic and security coverage is a primary focus
- All work so far follows NAMDRunner's "test our logic, not external libraries" philosophy
- Note: A full review of earlier task plans (phases 6.1–6.6) must still be completed to find any remaining gaps

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should we implement visual regression testing for UI components?
- [ ] Do we need performance benchmarking as part of the test suite?
- [ ] Should test coverage requirements vary by module criticality?
- [ ] How should we handle test data cleanup between test runs?
- [ ] What additional testing work is required after reviewing phases 6.1–6.6?
