# Phase 1 Milestone 1.2 - Mock Infrastructure

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Type**: Implementation Task  
**Priority**: High (required for complete offline development)  
**Phase**: 1 of 6
**Milestone**: 1.2 of 1.4

## Problem Statement
Complete the mock infrastructure to enable comprehensive offline development and testing. While basic mocks exist, we need comprehensive E2E testing with dual-purpose tools (static tests and agent investigation) and CI configuration to support the full development workflow without requiring actual cluster access.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement mock IPC client for UI development (completed in 1.1)
- [x] Create fixture data for testing (job states, SLURM responses) (completed in 1.1)  
- [x] Mock SLURM responses for offline development (completed in 1.1)
- [x] Set up dual-purpose testing infrastructure (UI and E2E)
- [x] Configure WebdriverIO with tauri-driver for E2E testing
- [x] Implement agent debug toolkit for autonomous development
- [x] Configure CI for Linux and Windows builds

## Prerequisites
- ✅ Phase 1 Milestone 1.1 (Foundation) completed
- ✅ Tauri app builds and runs successfully
- ✅ Basic mock implementations working

- Maintained JavaScript for tests (better for agent development)

#### 4.2 Unified Testing Commands
```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test            # Vitest for TypeScript/Svelte
cargo test              # Rust unit tests

# UI Testing (fast, mock backend)
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1280x720x24 &  # Virtual display
export DISPLAY=:99
npm run dev             # Start Vite dev server
npm run test:ui         # Agent debugging toolkit

# E2E Testing (full integration)
npm run test:e2e        # WebdriverIO with desktop app
```

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Areas
1. **WebDriver Integration**: Tauri WebDriver support may be limited
   - **Mitigation**: Start with basic tests, escalate complexity gradually
   
2. **CI Build Reliability**: Windows builds often have dependency issues
